# CTEC3905 Assignment

This repository contains basic boilerplate code for you to get started with.

You will need to replace the contents of these files with your own code.

## index.html

The `index.html` file includes a basic template with a link to the `css/styles.css` file and a script tag after the main content which links to the `js/scripts.js` file.

## css/styles.css

The `css/styles.css` file contains a basic starting template for a responsive page.

## js/scripts.js

The `js/scripts.js` file contains a simple console.log statement to confirm that it is being executed.

## Notes
I have created functions in javascript to generate the header for the webpages, I was finding myself copying & pasting across code constantly. This also makes the website scalable meaning more pages can be added with ease.

I realise that this will make ciewing each page harder and I aplogise for that. Viewing the elements in browser should suffice instead.

I am using an API called Spoonacular to pull recipe info to populate the site.
